### Euclidean algorithm
An algorithm which meant to calculate square's maximum size which will fit in a rectangle<br>
While trying to solve this algorithm I straight away thought about common dividers<br>
And I've said to my self that I must test it...<br>
I took a 48x20 rectangle and started thinking<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
The maximum divider for both numbers is `4`, right? `20 / 4 = 5`, `48 / 4 = 12`<br>
I started filling up my rectangle with many 4x4 squares.<br>

**WOAH** They're perfect!
